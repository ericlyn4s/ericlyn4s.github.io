> "John McKenzie started a coding program at his mansion. Apparently everyone's learning to code these days"

I looked out the passenger window as my mom told me this news, seeing John McKenzie's sprawling mansion across the cornfield and wondering what it'd be like to see the inside. Never mind the coding program, that definitely wasn't for me, but the chance to study within one of the most well-known properties in the state would be incredible. We continued driving and I never gave it a second thought.

Five years later, I'm starting my first adult job in Denver. I knew at the time that I wasn't exactly passionate about accounting, but it was a stable career and gave me plenty of options come graduation. And most importantly, it got me out of Indiana. I quickly made friends with other new-hires from different parts of the large company, one being a girl who worked as web developer. Her job seemed pretty interesting, but more from the perks than anything else. Her work environment felt entirely different from my own - no cubicles, no business formal attire, and a youthful collaborative environment. Soon her environment changed to a new start-up downtown, and I was undoubtedly jealous. But still, this wasn't due to the nature of her work, but the perks that came with the job.

It wasn't until a few months later that I realized coding might actually be for me. I decided to take a few free online classes, and realized it appealed to the logical side of my brain. The years building formulas in excel seemed similar to creating HTML code, and I realized I might have an aptitude for this line of work. This initial excitement soon turned to dismay, as it seemed pretty unlikely I had the resources to switch into this career. Thankfully, it's not difficult to attain an education in web development, and I wouldn't need to quit my job and return to college.

In the end, my casual brushes with the web development path amounted to an aspiration to break into the field. The signs seemed always to be pointing me into this direction, but I only recently became aware of the calling. I recently visited home, and as I passed John McKenzie's estate I no longer gazed admirably at the architecture, but felt a curiosity about the curriculum being taught from inside.
